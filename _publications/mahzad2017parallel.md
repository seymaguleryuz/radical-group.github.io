abstract: "The analysis of biomolecular computer simulations has become a
challenge because the amount of output data is now routinely in the terabyte
range. We evaluated if this challenge can be met by a parallel map-reduce
approach with the Dask parallel computing library for task-graph based computing
coupled with our MDAnalysis Python library for the analysis of molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. We performed a representative performance evaluation,
taking into account the highly heterogeneous computing environment that
researchers typically work in together with the diversity of existing file formats
for MD trajectory data. We found that the underlying storage system (solid state
drives, parallel file systems, or simple spinning platter disks) can be a deciding
performance factor that leads to data ingestion becoming the primary bottleneck
in the analysis work flow. However, the choice of the data file format can mitigate
the effect of the storage system; in particular, the commonly used Gromacs XTC
trajectory format, which is highly compressed, can exhibit strong scaling close to
ideal due to trading a decrease in global storage access load against an increase
in local per-core CPU-intensive decompression. Scaling was tested on a single
node and multiple nodes on national and local supercomputing resources as well
as typical workstations. Although very good strong scaling could be achieved for
single nodes, good scaling across multiple nodes was hindered by the persistent
occurrence of \"stragglers\", tasks that take much longer than all other tasks, and
whose ultimate cause could not be completely ascertained. In summary, we
show that, due to the focus on high interoperability in the scientific Python eco
system, it is straightforward to implement map-reduce with Dask in MDAnalysis
and provide an in-depth analysis of the considerations to obtain good parallel
performance on HPC resources."
