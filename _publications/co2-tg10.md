## Abstract
In this paper we lay out the computational challenges involved in effectively 
simulating complex phenomena such as sequestering CO2 in oil and gas reservoirs. 
The challenges arise at multiple levels: (i) the computational complexity of 
simulating the fundamental processes; (ii) the resource requirements of the 
computationally demanding simulations; (iii) the need for integrating real-time 
data (intensive) and computationally intensive simulations; (iv) and the need to 
implement all of these in a robust, scalable and extensible approach. We will 
outline the architecture and implementation of the solution we develop in response 
to these requirements, and discuss results to validate claims that our solution 
scales to effectively solve desired problem sizes and thus provides the capability 
to generate novel scientific insight.
