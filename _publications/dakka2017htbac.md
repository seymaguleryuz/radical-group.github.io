## Abstract:

Resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies is a major factor 
in limiting the effectiveness of cancer treatment. In many cases, resistance 
can be linked to genetic changes in target proteins, either pre-existing or 
evolutionarily selected during treatment. Key to overcoming this challenge is an understanding of the molecular determinants of drug binding. Using multi-stage 
pipelines of molecular simulations we can gain insights into the binding free 
energy and the residence time of a ligand, which can inform both stratified and 
personal treatment regimes and drug development. To support the scalable, 
adaptive and automated calculation of the binding free energy on 
high-performance computing resources, we introduce the High- throughput Binding 
Affinity Calculator (HTBAC). HTBAC uses a building block approach in order to 
attain both workflow flexibility and performance. We demonstrate close to 
perfect weak scaling to hundreds of concurrent multi-stage binding affinity 
calculation pipelines. This permits a rapid time-to-solution that is essentially 
invariant of the calculation protocol, size of candidate ligands and number of 
ensemble simulations. As such, HTBAC advances the state of the art of binding 
affinity calculations and protocols.
