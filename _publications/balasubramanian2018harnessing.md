## Abstract:

Many scientific problems require multiple distinct computational tasks to be
executed in order to achieve a desired solution. We introduce the Ensemble
Toolkit (EnTK) to address the challenges of scale, diversity and reliability
they pose. We describe the design and implementation of EnTK, characterize its
performance and integrate it with two distinct exemplar use cases: seismic
inversion and adaptive analog ensembles. We perform nine experiments,
characterizing EnTK overheads, strong and weak scalability, and the performance
of two use case implementations, at scale and on production infrastructures. We
show how EnTK meets the following general requirements: (i) implementing
dedicated abstractions to support the description and execution of ensemble
applications; (ii) support for execution on heterogeneous computing
infrastructures; (iii) efficient scalability up to O(10^4) tasks; and (iv) fault
tolerance. We discuss novel computational capabilities that EnTK enables and the
scientific advantages arising thereof. We propose EnTK as an important addition
to the suite of tools in support of production scientific computing.
