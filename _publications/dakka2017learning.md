abstract: "Smart systems that can accurately diagnose patients with mental disorders and
identify effective treatments based on brain functional imaging data are of great
applicability and are gaining much attention. Most previous machine learning
studies use hand-designed features, such as functional connectivity, which does not
maintain the potential useful information in the spatial relationship between brain
regions and the temporal profile of the signal in each region. Here we propose a
new method based on recurrent-convolutional neural networks to automatically
learn useful representations from segments of 4-D fMRI recordings. Our goal is to
exploit both spatial and temporal information in the functional MRI movie (at the
whole-brain voxel level) for identifying patients with schizophrenia."
