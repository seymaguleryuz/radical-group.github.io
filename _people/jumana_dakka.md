Jumana is a third year graduate student and is currently a member of the Research in Advanced Distributed Cyberinfrastructure and Application Laboratory.

As an undergraduate, she majored in biomedical engineering at Rutgers University. In the past she has worked on hemodynamics at Rutgers and the University of Pennsylvania. 

She worked on distributed machine learning applications to computational biology and neuroscience, with a particular focus on statistical analysis of brain imaging data such as fMRI. Currently, her focus is on adaptive applications. She is one of the developers of [RADICAL-HTBAC](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/htbac), a Python library that enables adaptive, high throughput binding free energy calculations at scale on high-performance platforms such as NCSA Blue Waters and ORNL Titan.
