I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Rutgers University.  I'm currently working with the RADICAL group and Robert Kopp on a flexible computational framework for projecting future sea-level rise from global to local scales.  Our goal is to provide new sea-level rise projections for the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report (AR6).
