I am Assistant Research Professor at the department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), Rutgers University. Before moving to Rutgers, I was the Chair of the [EGI Federated Cloud](https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_Federated_Cloud) and Senior Research Associate at the [Oxford e-Research Centre (OeRC)](https://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford, UK. My research interests primarily concern bridging the gap between distributed and high performance computing, designing middleware for scientific cyberinfrastructures, and supporting domain-specific scientific workflows. I collaborate with several domain scientists to enable research in biological sciences, earth sciences, climate sciences and particle physics. For my research, I use production infrastructures like [OLCF](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/olcf-resources/), [NCSA](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/), [NCAR](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/resources-overview) and [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/), performing large-scale experiments on among the [biggest "supercomputers"](https://www.top500.org/) currently available. Highly motivated students with similar research interests and looking for joining a Master or PhD program are always welcome to get in contact.
